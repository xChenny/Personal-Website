# My Personal Website

## What is this project?

This website is meant to show off some of the works that I am most proud of. Hopefully after you browse through the website, you will find out more about me as a person and software developer. 

## How this site was built

I used the Jekyll framework that allows you to easily make an attractive, low-maintenance website that you can easily add extra static content when needed.

## Credits

I used the particle theme that is licensed with MIT open source that was created by Github user [nrandecker](https://github.com/nrandecker/)
